About feed and its utilization
Life stage	Fish size(g)	Feed type	Feed size(mm)	Feeding rate
(% body weight)	Feeding frequency(no./day)
Fry	0.3–1.0	crumble	0.3–0.7	5	10
Fingerling	1.0–25.0	pellet	0.7–2.0	3	4
Grower	25–1500	pellet	2.0–4.5	2	2
Broodstock	>1500	pellet	5	1.5	2
Feeding may be done by hand or with a mechanical distribution system. Feed should be distributed throughout the pond as homogeneously as possible.

Fry and fingerling trout require a higher protein and energy content in their diets than larger fish. Fry and fingerling feed should contain approximately 50 percent protein and 15 to 20 percent fat. Feeds for larger fish typically contain 38 to 45 percent protein and 10 to 18 percent fat.

Feed first thing in the morning when the water temperature is coolest.
